## Main point
`in place`  
to create two cursor, one to traverse, other to save appropriate value and follow.

`remove the duplicates`
> if(A[j] != A[i]) then ...

`return new length of array`  
the following cursor is just the new length + 1.

## Code architecture
 all algorithmic implementations, as member function of class ArrayAlgo, is to be called on main function. [see details][1].   

 array including elements and number, as member data of class ArrayAlgo, is to be structured on main function.
